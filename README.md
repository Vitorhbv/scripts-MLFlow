# MLFlow Scripts for LLMs ðŸš€

This repository contains a collection of useful **MLFlow** scripts specifically designed to simplify the tracking, logging, and management of experiments involving **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.

## ðŸ“„ Overview

The goal of this repository is to centralize and organize small, reusable scripts that i made with my integration of MLFLow and Litellm. I Also used langchain to make the automatic tracing of my enviroment to track and store in MLFlow.

These scripts cover common tasks such as:

- âœ… Tracking experiments
- âœ… Logging model parameters, metrics, and artifacts
- âœ… Managing MLFlow runs
- âœ… Testing MLFlow features with LLM-specific use cases
